Surge leverages [Nethermind](https://www.nethermind.io/nethermind-client) as its primary Ethereum execution client. Nethermind is a high-performance client designed for speed, efficiency, and reliability – all essential qualities for any rollup aiming to process transactions at scale.

## Why Nethermind?

Nethermind stands out for its:
- **High Performance:** Built for gigagas throughput (as showcased in [Nethermind v1.30.0](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/releases/tag/1.30.0)), the client ensures quick transaction processing.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Nethermind’s optimized architecture helps reduce overhead, enabling Surge to handle large volumes of transactions without excessive costs.
- **Robust Ethereum Compatibility:** As a proven client in the Ethereum ecosystem, Nethermind aligns perfectly with Surge’s rollup strategy, ensuring reliable execution for developers and end users.

## Benefits for Surge

By integrating Nethermind, Surge achieves:

### Faster Block Execution
Transactions confirm faster due to Nethermind’s streamlined execution approach. This leads to improved user experiences and lower latency for dApps built on Surge.

### Optimized Resource Usage
Nethermind’s low-overhead design allows Surge to process more transactions without incurring higher execution costs. This efficiency is crucial for maintaining a decentralized and cost-effective rollup.
