# Tokenless Design

Surge takes a **token-free** approach to decentralization. While many rollups introduce governance tokens to align community incentives, experience has shown that governance tokens can create misaligned incentives and concentrate power among large holders.

## Why No Token?

- **Incentive Alignment:** Rather than relying on a token with its own speculative pressures, Surge aligns with Ethereum’s existing economic model.
- **Reduced Complexity:** Without a governance token, Surge avoids the pitfalls of complicated voting processes and token-holding concentrations. (Learn more about [common governance token pitfalls](https://blog.colony.io/governance-token/) and [DeFi governance token roles](https://www.openware.com/news/articles/the-role-of-governance-tokens-in-defi-projects).)
- **Long-Term Sustainability:** By not introducing an additional token, Surge remains focused on sustainable growth and decentralization rather than short-term market speculation.

## ETH for Gas

Surge uses **ETH** as the native currency for gas payments:
- **Burning ETH:** Transaction fees on Surge contribute to Ethereum’s deflationary mechanic, reinforcing the network’s [ultra-sound money](https://ultrasound.money) principles.
- **Simplicity:** This approach aligns directly with Ethereum’s economic model, streamlining the user experience and reducing overhead.
