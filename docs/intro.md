# Introduction to Surge

Surge is a maximally aligned, high-performance Ethereum rollup built on modified Taiko technology. It inherits Ethereumâ€™s security while providing enhanced performance and composability.

## What is Surge?

Surge is a high-performance and censorship-resistant Ethereum rollup template, meant as a technical showcase that is designed to be:

- Maximally Ethereum-aligned
- Stage 2 from launch
- Provide Gigagas performance
- Censorship-resistant
- Optimized for user experience with low transaction costs and confirmation times
- Focused on cross-layer composability
- Built on proven Taiko technology, modified to remove token dependencies

## Architecture

Learn about the [Surge Architecture](./About/architecture).

## Deploying Your DApp on Surge

Follow our [DApp Deployment Guidelines](./Guides/deploy-dapps/deploy-on-surge).

## Running Your Surge Rollup

Follow the [Running Surge](./Guides/running-surge) guide.

## Key Features

- Uses ETH as a gas token
- Gigagas per second gas throughput
- ZK proving system with multiple proving options
- Cross-layer composability support (coming soon)
- Open source & maximally Ethereum-aligned
- The owner multisig has a 45-day timelock on any action to allow users ample time to exit with their funds.

## Goals

- Push the Rollup Centric Roadmap forward with engineering and research
- Maintain censorship resistance
- Enable seamless composability with L1 and other rollups

## Non-Goals

- Capture users and revenue
- Compete with other rollups
