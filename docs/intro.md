# Introduction to Surge

Surge is a maximally aligned, high-performance Ethereum rollup built on modified Taiko technology. It inherits Ethereum's security while providing enhanced performance and composability

## What is Surge?

Surge is a novel high-performance, and censorship-resistant Ethereum rollup meant as a technical showcase that is designed to be:

- A based rollup with maximum Ethereum alignment
- Stage 2 from launch
- Provide Gigagas performance
- Censorship resistant
- Optimized for user experience with low transaction costs and confirmation times
- Focused on cross-layer composability
- Built on proven Taiko technology, modified to remove token dependencies

## Architecture

Learn about the [Surge Architecture](/About/architecture)

## Roadmap

We will deploy Surge in the following Phases:

![Surge Roadmap](/img/surge-roadmap.png)

- Surge Testnet Alpha will be rolled out anchoring on Holesky
- Surge Testnet will be rolled out anchoring on Hoodi
- Surge Mainnet will be rolled out anchoring on Ethereum Mainnet 

## Deploying your DApp on surge

Follow our [DApp Deployment Guideline](/Guides/deploy-dapps/deploy-on-surge)

## Running your Surge rollup

Follow the [Running Surge](/running-surge) guide

## Key Features

- Stage 2 from Launch
- Uses ETH as a gas token
- Gigagas Per Second gas throughput
- ZK proving system with multiple proving options
- Cross-layer composability support (Coming soon)
- Open source & Maximally Ethereum Aligned

## Goals

- Push the Rollup Centric Roadmap forward with engineering and research
- Maintain censorship resistance
- Enable seamless composability with L1 and other rollups
- Showcase how Nethermind technology can be used for building high performant rollups

## Non-Goals

- Capture users and revenue
- Compete with other rollups
