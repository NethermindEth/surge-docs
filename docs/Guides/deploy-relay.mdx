# Deploy Relayer

This guide walks you through the process of deploying and configuring the Surge Relayer.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Clone Repository

First, clone the Surge Taiko Mono repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/surge-taiko-mono.git
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Navigate to the relayer package and prepare the configuration:

```bash
cd surge-taiko-mono/packages/relayer
cp .default.env .env
```

Edit `.env`, make sure `L1_RPC_URL` and `L2_RPC_URL` are set correctly.

### 3. Deploy Components

Deploy the relayer components in the following sequence:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="init" label="Initialize Components" default>

        ```bash
        docker compose --profile init up -d
        ```

        This command starts the relayer database and queue services.
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="migrations" label="Run Migrations">

        ```bash
        # Wait for services to be ready
        sleep 20

        # Run migrations
        docker compose --profile migrations up
        ```

        This step sets up the necessary database schema and initial configurations.
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="relayer" label="Start Relayer">

        ```bash
        docker compose --profile l1 --profile l2 --profile api up -d
        ```

        This starts the main relayer service.
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Verification

After deployment, verify that:

1. Database is properly initialized
2. Migrations completed successfully
3. Relayer service is running and connected to both L1 and L2

## Component Health Checks

Monitor the health of your deployment:

```bash
# Check running containers
docker compose ps

# View logs of required relayer components, e.g. processor
docker logs relayer-l1-processor

# Check database status
docker compose logs db -f
```

:::warning Important
Ensure all components are running before proceeding with any network operations. The relayer is a critical component for cross-layer communication.
:::

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Connection Issues**

- Verify L1 and L2 RPC endpoints are accessible
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure all contract addresses are correct

2. **Database Issues**

- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check migration logs for errors
- Ensure database credentials are correct

3. **Service Issues**

- Check container logs for errors
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Ensure sufficient system resources

:::tip Need Help?
If you continue to experience issues, check the logs using:

```bash
docker compose logs --tail=100
```
