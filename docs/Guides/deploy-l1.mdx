- Git installed on your system
- Terminal access
- Basic command line knowledge

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Kurtosis

First, you'll need to install Kurtosis on your system. Follow the installation guide at:

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the Preconfirm devnet package repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/preconfirm-devnet-package.git
```

### 3. Switch to the Correct Branch

Navigate to the cloned directory and checkout the `surge/devnet` branch:

```bash
cd preconfirm-devnet-package
git checkout surge/devnet
```

### 4. Deploy Using Kurtosis

Run Kurtosis with the following command to deploy the L1 network:

```bash
kurtosis run --enclave core-rollup . --args-file network_params.yaml
```

:::tip
This command will also automatically deploy the Taiko protocol on L1 for you.

## Verification

After running the deployment command, Kurtosis will start setting up your L1 environment. You should see output in your terminal indicating the progress of the deployment.

:::info What's Next?
Once your L1 deployment is complete, you can proceed with setting up your prover or configuring additional network parameters.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. Ensure all prerequisites are properly installed
2. Verify you're on the correct branch (`surge/devnet`)
3. Check that the `network_params.yaml` file exists and is properly configured
4. Make sure Kurtosis is running correctly on your system
