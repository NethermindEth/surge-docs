# Introduction

This section guides you through the process of running the required components for setting up a Surge rollup on the
Hoodi network. To fully run Surge on Hoodi, you will need to have operating L1 node (Hoodi) and an L2 node (Surge).

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- At least 16GB of RAM
- At least 100GB of free disk space
- Stable internet connection

These prerequisites are chosen based on typical requirements for blockchain nodes, considering data size, processing
demands, and optimal performance.
