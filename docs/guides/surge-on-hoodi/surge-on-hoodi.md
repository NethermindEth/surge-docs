# Introduction

This section guides you through the process of running the required components for setting up a Surge rollup on the
Hoodi network. To fully run Surge on Hoodi, you will need to have operating L1 node (Hoodi) and an L2 node (Surge).

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- At least 16GB of RAM
- At least 100GB of free disk space
- Stable internet connection

These prerequisites are chosen based on typical requirements for blockchain nodes, considering data size, processing
demands, and optimal performance.

## Steps

This guide is structured into two main steps:

1. [Run L1](./run-l1.md): Instructions for running or connecting to a Hoodi Layer 1 node.
2. [Run L2](./run-l2.mdx): Steps to run your Surge Layer 2 node on top of Hoodi.

## Troubleshooting

If you face any issues at any of the steps, feel free to refer to
the [Troubleshooting section](docs/troubleshooting/index.mdx) for additional support.
