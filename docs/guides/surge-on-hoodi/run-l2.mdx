# Run L2

:::tip
This guide is fairly similar to the [Deploy L2](../running-surge/deploy-l2.mdx) guide. The main difference is that this guide is focused on running the components of the Surge rollup on the Hoodi testnet, while the other one is more general.
:::

A Layer 2 network builds on top of Layer 1 to increase scalability and reduce transaction costs, while still inheriting L1’s security. For Surge, the L2 network is where user transactions are executed and blocks are proposed and proven.

This guide provides clear instructions for running Surge’s L2 components using the [Simple Surge Node](https://github.com/NethermindEth/simple-surge-node), enabling you to run and test the core rollup logic.

To see how L2 fits into the overall system, refer to the [Surge Architecture documentation](/docs/about/architecture).

## Setup Process

Follow these steps to set up and run your L2 network:

### 1. Clone Repository

Clone the [Simple Surge Node](https://github.com/NethermindEth/simple-surge-node) repository and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/simple-surge-node.git
cd simple-surge-node
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create your environment configuration file (`.env`) by copying the provided sample:

```bash
cp .env.hoodi .env
```

:::tip Environment Configuration
The `.env.hoodi` file contains default configuration values for Hoodi. You can customize these settings — such as L1 and L2 parameters, genesis hashes, and contract addresses — as needed.

And make sure to update the L1 URLs to match the ones you're using.
:::

:::note
`host.docker.internal` values in the `.env` file might not work in all environments. If you encounter issues, replace `host.docker.internal` with your server's IP address or hostname.
:::


### 3. Start Script 

Start the script for deploying Surge stack components:
```bash 
./surge-stack-deployer.sh
```

You'll see the same prompts as in the [3. Start Protocol Deployment Script section](#3-start-protocol-deployment-script).
Set the same values as before to ensure the script uses the correct configuration. 

### 4. Stack Components

The script will ask you which components you want to deploy:

```bash
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ Enter L2 stack option:                                       ║
║ 1 for driver only                                            ║
║ 2 for driver + proposer                                      ║
║ 3 for driver + proposer + spammer                            ║
║ 4 for driver + proposer + prover + spammer                   ║
║ 5 for all except spammer                                     ║
║ [default: all]                                               ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

- `Driver` - Starts the Nethermind Execution Client for L2 network operation

- `Proposer` - Initiates the Proposer service for transaction bundling and block proposals

- `Prover` - Starts the Prover Relayer for proof relay, this component requests proofs from your provers and submits them on-chain.

- `Spammer` - Launches a transaction spammer to generate load on the L2 network for testing purposes

Choose the option that best fits your testing or deployment needs. For a full setup, select option `5` to deploy all components except the spammer.

### 5. Relayer and Bridge UI

The script will ask you:

```bash
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ Start relayers? (true/false) [default: true]                 ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

In this step the script starts the relayer for L1 and L2 communication, starts several other components like Bridge UI and BlockScout.

#### Bridge UI
The Bridge UI is the user-facing interface for transferring assets between Layer 1 and Layer 2, enabling seamless interaction with Surge’s cross-chain functionality. It relies on the underlying Relayer and smart contracts to facilitate these transfers securely.

#### Relayer 
The Relayer is a key component that facilitates cross-layer communication between Layer 1 and Layer 2, such as submitting proofs or syncing finalized state. It ensures that Surge’s L2 state transitions are correctly reflected and verified on L1.

#### BlockScout
Provides a web-based interface to:
- Explore blocks, transactions, and accounts
- Verify smart contracts
- Monitor network activity
- Track token transfers and balances

## Regarding P2P Synchronization

A bare-minimum Surge L2 node consists of two components: the **Driver** (from taiko-client) and an **Execution Client** (Nethermind in our case). When launching a node for the first time, you have two options to build the chain state:

### Two Synchronization Methods

**1. Manual Sync via L1**

The driver iterates through all blocks from the L1 origin of L2 genesis to the latest L1 head, fetching `BatchProposed` events and blob sidecars (if present), then inserts blocks into the execution client one by one.

This approach becomes problematic on mature chains because older L2 blobs may have already been pruned from the L1 beacon node (typically after ~18 days). To work around this, you would need either:
- An archive L1 node that preserves all historical blobs in its consensus layer
- A blob storage service (such as BlobScan) configured in the driver
- P2P sync instead (recommended)

**2. P2P Sync (Recommended)**

P2P synchronization allows your node to build its chain state by downloading blocks directly from peer nodes in the network, bypassing the blob pruning limitation. The driver triggers beacon synchronization by making RPC calls to the execution client, which then initiates P2P sync using the provided bootnodes.

:::tip Surge Testnet Default
For Surge Testnet (Hoodi), P2P sync is enabled by default in the `.env.hoodi` configuration file. We provide our own checkpoint sync URL and bootnode addresses, so your node can synchronize quickly without any additional configuration.
:::

### Key Terminology

**Bootnode**: A specialized node that serves as an entry point for new nodes joining the network via P2P. Bootnodes maintain information about active peer nodes and help newcomers discover and connect to the network. When your node starts with P2P sync enabled, it contacts the bootnode to obtain a list of peers to synchronize with.

**Enode (Ethereum Node)**: A unique identifier for each node in the network, consisting of the node's public key and network address. It allows nodes to locate and establish connections with each other. An enode looks like:
```
enode://[node-id]@[ip-address]:[port]
```

The bootnode's enode address is what you configure in the `BOOT_NODES` environment variable.

### Configuration Variables

The simple-surge-node implementation provides these environment variables to control P2P synchronization:

**`ENABLE_P2P_SYNC`**: Set to `true` to enable P2P synchronization or `false` to disable it. When enabled, your node will connect to bootnodes and synchronize via P2P instead of fetching all data from L1.

**`BOOT_NODES`**: Enode addresses of bootnode(s) that your node will connect to for P2P synchronization. For Surge Testnet, these are pre-configured in the `.env.hoodi` file.

**`P2P_SYNC_URL`**: A valid L2 HTTP RPC URL used as a checkpoint for faster synchronization. This helps your node determine the target block height to sync to.

**`L2_NETWORK_DISCOVERY_PORT`**: The network port used for P2P communication and peer discovery.

### When to Use P2P Sync

**Enable P2P sync (recommended) when:**
- Joining Surge Testnet or any established Surge network
- The L1 beacon node has pruned older blobs (chains older than ~18 days)
- You want faster synchronization by downloading blocks from existing peers
- You don't have access to an archive L1 node or blob storage service

**Disable P2P sync only when:**
- You're setting up a completely new isolated network for development
- You have a fresh chain where all blobs are still available on L1
- You explicitly want to sync exclusively via L1 despite slower performance

:::note Network Requirements
If your node operates behind firewalls or NAT, ensure the P2P port specified in `L2_NETWORK_DISCOVERY_PORT` is open and properly forwarded to allow peer connections. This enables your node to participate fully in the P2P network.

## Verification

After launching all components, ensure everything is running correctly by:

- Checking the status of Docker containers using `docker compose ps`.
- Monitoring logs for startup errors with `docker compose --profile <profile_name> logs -f --tail 100`.
- Verifying network connectivity between components.

## Troubleshooting

If issues arise during launch:

- Confirm environment variables in `.env` are correctly configured.
- Review Docker logs for detailed error information.
- Ensure required ports are open and accessible.
- Check network connectivity between the launched components.
