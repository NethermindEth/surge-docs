# Run L2

:::tip
This guide is fairly similar to the [Deploy L2](../running-surge/deploy-l2.mdx) guide. The main difference is that this guide is focused on running the components of the Surge rollup on the Hoodi testnet, while the other one is more general.
:::

A Layer 2 network builds on top of Layer 1 to increase scalability and reduce transaction costs, while still inheriting L1’s security. For Surge, the L2 network is where user transactions are executed and blocks are proposed and proven.

This guide provides clear instructions for running Surge’s L2 components using the [Simple Surge Node](https://github.com/NethermindEth/simple-surge-node), enabling you to run and test the core rollup logic.

To see how L2 fits into the overall system, refer to the [Surge Architecture documentation](/docs/about/architecture).

## Setup Process

Follow these steps to set up and run your L2 network:

### 1. Clone Repository

Clone the [Simple Surge Node](https://github.com/NethermindEth/simple-surge-node) repository and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/simple-surge-node.git
cd simple-surge-node
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create your environment configuration file (`.env`) by copying the provided sample:

```bash
cp .env.hoodi .env
```

:::note
`host.docker.internal` values in the `.env` file might not work in all environments. If you encounter issues, replace `host.docker.internal` with your server's IP address or hostname.
:::

### 4. Start Components

Deploying L2 involves sequentially starting five components. Ensure you follow the correct order for proper communication between them.

:::info Component Order
Start components in this order:

1. **Driver**: Manages network execution via Nethermind Execution Client.
2. **Proposer**: Handles transaction bundling and block proposals.
3. **Prover Relayer**: Relays proofs received from provers.

Following this sequence ensures components initialize correctly.
:::

:::note
If you did not deploy a prover in the previous setup steps, you can safely skip launching the prover relayer.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="driver" label="Driver" default>

    Starts the Nethermind Execution Client for L2 network operation:

    ```bash
    docker compose --profile nethermind_execution_l2 up -d
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="proposer" label="Proposer">

    Initiates the Proposer service for transaction bundling and block proposals:

    ```bash
    docker compose --profile proposer up -d
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="prover" label="Prover Relayer">

    Launches the Prover Relayer for proof relay:

    ```bash
    docker compose --profile prover up -d
    ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Verification

After deploying all components, ensure everything is running correctly by:

- Checking the status of Docker containers using `docker compose ps`.
- Monitoring logs for startup errors with `docker compose --profile <profile_name> logs -f --tail 100`.
- Verifying network connectivity between components.

## Troubleshooting

If issues arise during deployment:

- Confirm environment variables in `.env` are correctly configured.
- Review Docker logs for detailed error information.
- Ensure required ports are open and accessible.
- Check network connectivity between the deployed components.
