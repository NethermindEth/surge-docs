# Run L2

:::tip
This guide is fairly similar to the [Deploy L2](../running-surge/deploy-l2.mdx) guide. The main difference is that this guide is focused on running the components of the Surge rollup on the Hoodi testnet, while the other one is more general.
:::

A Layer 2 network builds on top of Layer 1 to increase scalability and reduce transaction costs, while still inheriting L1’s security. For Surge, the L2 network is where user transactions are executed and blocks are proposed and proven.

This guide provides clear instructions for running Surge’s L2 components using the [Simple Surge Node](https://github.com/NethermindEth/simple-surge-node), enabling you to run and test the core rollup logic.

To see how L2 fits into the overall system, refer to the [Surge Architecture documentation](/docs/about/architecture).

## Setup Process

Follow these steps to set up and run your L2 network:

### 1. Clone Repository

Clone the [Simple Surge Node](https://github.com/NethermindEth/simple-surge-node) repository and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/simple-surge-node.git
cd simple-surge-node
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create your environment configuration file (`.env`) by copying the provided sample:

```bash
cp .env.hoodi .env
```

:::tip Environment Configuration
The `.env.hoodi` file contains default configuration values for Hoodi. You can customize these settings — such as L1 and L2 parameters, genesis hashes, and contract addresses — as needed.

And make sure to update the L1 URLs to match the ones you're using.
:::

:::note
`host.docker.internal` values in the `.env` file might not work in all environments. If you encounter issues, replace `host.docker.internal` with your server's IP address or hostname.
:::

### 4. Start Components

L2 consists of the following components, feel free to launch the ones specific to your needs.

:::tip
You can run multiple profiles at once:

```bash
docker compose --profile <profile1> --profile <profile2> up -d
```
:::

#### Driver

:::tip
If you just want to follow the L2 chain, launching just the driver is sufficient.
:::

Starts the Nethermind Execution Client for L2 network operation:

```bash
docker compose --profile nethermind_execution_l2 up -d
```

#### Proposer
Initiates the Proposer service for transaction bundling and block proposals:

```bash
docker compose --profile proposer up -d
```

#### Prover Relayer

:::note
If you did not deploy a prover in the previous setup steps, you can safely skip launching the prover relayer.
:::

Launches the Prover Relayer for proof relay:

```bash
docker compose --profile prover up -d
```

#### Metrics
Sets up Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring:

```bash
docker compose --profile metrics up -d
```

## Verification

After launching all components, ensure everything is running correctly by:

- Checking the status of Docker containers using `docker compose ps`.
- Monitoring logs for startup errors with `docker compose --profile <profile_name> logs -f --tail 100`.
- Verifying network connectivity between components.

## Troubleshooting

If issues arise during launch:

- Confirm environment variables in `.env` are correctly configured.
- Review Docker logs for detailed error information.
- Ensure required ports are open and accessible.
- Check network connectivity between the launched components.
