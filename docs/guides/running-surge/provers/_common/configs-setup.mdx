Both `chain_spec_list.json` and `config.json` files are placed in `raiko/host/config/devnet` for devnet and `raiko/host/config/testnet` for testnet.
You could edit existing ones or create new ones based on your chain configuration.

Here are the most important parameters to check in config.json:

- `address`: the address of the prover server
- `network`: the network name of the l2
- `concurrency_limit`: the number of concurrent proving tasks the prover can handle
- `l1_network`: the network name of the l1
- `ballot_zk`: configuration for `zk_any` request.
- `ballot_sgx`: configuration for `sgx_any` request.

Basically this `config.json` file is used as default proof request config, but client could override it with specific values.

File `chain_spec_list.json` is generated while deploying the protocol, you should just copy it. Don't change anything here unless you know what you are doing.
