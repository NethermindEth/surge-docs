Both `chain_spec_list.json` and `config.json` files are placed in `raiko/host/config/devnet` for devnet and `raiko/host/config/testnet` for testnet.
You can edit existing configs or create new ones based on your chain configuration.

:::tip
If you are deploying a new chain with [Simple Surge Node](https://github.com/NethermindEth/simple-surge-node) `surge-protocol-deployer.sh` script, `chain_spec_list.json` will be generated for you. 
You just need to copy it from `simple-surge-node/configs/chain_spec_list_default.json` into your prover config folder
(e.g. `raiko/host/config/devnet/chain_spec_list.json`).
:::

Here are the most important parameters to check in `config.json`:

- `address`: The address of the prover server
- `network`: The network name of the L2
- `concurrency_limit`: The number of concurrent proving tasks the prover can handle
- `l1_network`: The network name of the L1
- `ballot_zk`: Configuration for `zk_any` request
- `ballot_sgx`: Configuration for `sgx_any` request

This `config.json` file is used as the default proof request config, but clients can override it with specific values.

:::note 
The `chain_spec_list.json` file is generated when deploying the protocol. You should copy it as-is. Don't change anything in this file unless you know what you are doing.
