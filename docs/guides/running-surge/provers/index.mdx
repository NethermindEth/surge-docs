# Set up a Prover

:::note
You **can** skip launching provers in a local devnet if you only want to test basic transaction flow and block proposals. However, without **all three** provers:
- No L2 blocks will ever be proven or finalized on-chain.
- Any actions requiring finalized state (e.g., bridging back to L1, claiming certain rewards) will remain pending or unavailable.

Launching all three provers locally can be challenging due to:
- **Hardware Requirements**: Certain provers (e.g., SGX) require specialized hardware or secure enclaves.
- **Complex Setup**: Installing and configuring toolchains, drivers, or required libraries can be time-consuming.
:::

In a based rollup like Surge, provers generate cryptographic proofs verifying L2 blocks proposed by proposers. These proofs are then submitted on-chain through a prover-relayer, marking blocks as verified (finalized).

Without provers submitting proofs, blocks remain unverified, limiting critical functionalities such as cross-chain finalizations.

To see how provers fit into the overall system, refer to the [Surge Architecture documentation](/docs/about/architecture).

## Understanding Provers in Surge

### What is a Prover?
A prover is a component responsible for generating cryptographic proofs that validate the correctness and integrity of Layer 2 transactions and blocks. Surge leverages multiple provers to ensure the security and reliability of rollup chains.

### Why Do You Need Provers?
Provers are essential because:
- They guarantee that only valid transactions and blocks are finalized on-chain.
- They enable trustless, secure interactions between Layer 2 and Layer 1, facilitating safe bridging and asset transfers.
- They maintain the integrity and finality of the blockchain, preventing invalid or fraudulent state transitions.

### How Do Provers Work?
Provers execute computationally intensive algorithms to create succinct proofs that validate batches of L2 transactions. Once generated, these proofs are submitted on-chain via a prover-relayer, which then finalizes and confirms the validity of these transactions on the blockchain.

## Required Provers for Surge

Surge requires the following three provers for complete functionality in production scenarios:

- [SGX Prover](sgx-prover.mdx)
- [RISC0 Prover](risc0-prover.mdx)
- [SP1 Prover](sp1-prover.mdx)

Each prover has distinct setup and operational requirements. Follow the respective guides carefully to properly configure, deploy, and maintain each prover.
