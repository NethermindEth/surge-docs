# Register Provers

The Surge protocol requires provers to be registered before they can participate in block finalization. 
This guide walks you through the steps to register your provers in the Surge protocol.

Registration is performed using the `surge-protocol-deployer.sh` script, right after the 
`Running provers? (true/false) [default: false]` prompt. 

:::tip
If you skipped the `Running provers?` step during deployment or 
canceled the script, you can run it again to register your provers.

The deployment script will find the existing deployment and ask you whether you want to continue with it or start a new one.

## 1. Specify Prover Machine Addresses

Right after the `Running provers? (true/false) [default: false]` prompt, 
you will be prompted to enter the addresses of your running provers.
Simply type the address (e.g. `http://localhost:8080`) for each machine. 

:::tip
Typically, prover machines should be two: one for SGX (both SGX_RETH and SGX_GETH) and one for 
ZK provers (SP1 and RISC Zero).

## 2. Specify Provers You Want to Register 

The script will generate `chain_spec_list.json` and environment variables for your provers.

Next, it will ask you to specify which provers you want to register:

```bash
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ Running SGX Raiko? (true/false) [default: false]              ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Simply type "`true`" for provers you want to register and "`false`" for the others.
The script will automatically pull the registration data from each running prover and register 
them for you.


## 3. Next Steps

Now you can resume your [L2 Deployment process](../deploy-l2.mdx#5-depositing-bond) if you haven't completed that step yet.
