# Deploy Relayer

This guide walks you through deploying and configuring the Surge Relayer, a critical component responsible for cross-layer communication between L1 and L2 networks.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the [Surge Taiko Mono repository](https://github.com/NethermindEth/surge-taiko-mono) to your local environment and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/surge-taiko-mono.git
cd surge-taiko-mono/
```

## Step 2: Checkout the Branch

Switch to the correct branch (`surge/devnet`):

```bash
git checkout surge/devnet
```

## Step 3: Environment Configuration

Navigate to the relayer package and set up your environment variables:

```bash
cd packages/relayer
cp .default.env .env
```
:::note
The `.default.env` file contains default values for `L1_RPC_URL` and `L2_RPC_URL` based on the configuration steps completed earlier. These defaults are suitable for most setups, but feel free to update them to match your own environment if needed.

## Step 4: Relayer Deployment

Deploy the relayer components in the following sequence:

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="init" label="1. Initialize Components" default>

    ### Initialize Components

    Run the command to start necessary services:

    ```bash
    docker compose --profile init up -d
    ```

    This starts essential services such as the relayer database and queue.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="migrations" label="2. Run Database Migrations">

    ### Run Database Migrations

    Allow some time (20 seconds recommended) for services to initialize, then execute migrations:

    ```bash
    # Wait for services to initialize
    sleep 20

    # Execute migrations
    docker compose --profile migrations up
    ```

    This step establishes your database schema and initial configurations required by the relayer.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="relayer" label="3. Start the Relayer Service">

    ### Start Relayer Service

    Launch the main relayer services, connecting both L1 and L2:

    ```bash
    docker compose --profile l1 --profile l2 --profile api up -d
    ```

    This will activate the relayer service along with API interfaces.

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Verification

Post-deployment verification steps:

- Ensure the database initialization succeeded.
- Confirm database migrations completed without errors.
- Validate the relayer is running and properly connected to L1 and L2.

### Health Checks

Use the following commands to verify component health:

```bash
# List running containers
docker compose ps

# View logs for specific components, e.g., L1 processor
docker logs relayer-l1-processor

# Monitor database logs
docker compose logs db -f --tail=100

# Review migration logs for errors.
docker compose logs migrations
```

:::warning Important
Ensure all relayer components are fully operational before proceeding with network operations. The relayer is a critical component for cross-layer communication.
