# Deploy L1

This guide walks you through the process of deploying an L1 network with Kurtosis, including the Taiko protocol deployment on L1. By the end, you will have a fully functioning L1 environment running inside a Kurtosis enclave.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Kurtosis

To begin, install Kurtosis by following the official installation guide:

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <a
    className="button button--primary button--lg"
    href="https://docs.kurtosis.com/install"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    Kurtosis Installation Guide â†—
  </a>
</div>

Once installed, verify that Kurtosis is running by checking the engine status:

```bash
kurtosis engine status
```

If successful, you should see output similar to:

```
A Kurtosis engine is running with the following info:
Version:   1.6.0
```

### 2. Clone Repository

Next, clone the surge-devnet-package repository and navigate into its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/surge-devnet-package.git
cd surge-devnet-package
```

## Deploying the L1 Network

Once you have Kurtosis installed and the repository cloned, you can deploy the L1 network with the Taiko protocol using this command:

```bash
kurtosis run --enclave surge-devnet . --args-file network_params.yaml --production
```

This command not only deploys the L1 network but also automatically deploys the Taiko protocol on L1. Monitor your terminal output for details on the deployment progress.

## Verification

Kurtosis will begin setting up your L1 environment. You can verify that everything is running by inspecting the `surge-devnet` enclave:

```bash
kurtosis enclave inspect surge-devnet
```

A list of all active services should be displayed, confirming that the L1 network and Taiko protocol have been successfully deployed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment, try the following:

1. Confirm that the network_params.yaml file is present in the surge-devnet-package directory.
2. Verify that Kurtosis is properly installed and running with the correct version (kurtosis engine status).
