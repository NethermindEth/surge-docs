# Deploying your DApp on Surge

To deploy your DApp on Surge follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- *Holesky* ETH on L1: ([Holesky Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/holesky))
- Surge L2 RPC: ([https://l2-rpc.surge.staging-nethermind.xyz](https://l2-rpc.surge.staging-nethermind.xyz)). Find all the settings and autoconfigure your wallet on ([ChainList](https://chainlist.org/chain/763374))
- Surge L2 Blockscout URL: ([Blockscout](https://explorer.holesky.surge.wtf/))

## Bridge Eth in to Surge

You can use the ([bridge UI](https://bridge.holesky.surge.wtf)) to transfer ETH from L1 to L2

Your transfer can be monitored from our ([Blockscout](https://explorer.holesky.surge.wtf/)) instance.

In its default settings, our relayer will automatically claim your bridged ETH for you within a minute after the transfer is confirmed.

## Deploy your DApp

You can now deploy your DApp like you would on any other EVM network. No changes are required to your DApp's code.
Happy testing!
