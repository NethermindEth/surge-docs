# Deploy Your DApp on Surge

This guide will walk you through the steps to successfully deploy your decentralized application (DApp) on the Surge
Hoodi Testnet.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying your DApp, ensure you have the following:

- **Hoodi ETH on L1**: Get test ETH using the [Hoodi Faucet](https://hoodi-faucet.pk910.de/).
- **Surge L2 RPC**: Connect your wallet to Surge L2 using the RPC
  endpoint: [https://l2-rpc.hoodi.surge.wtf](https://l2-rpc.hoodi.surge.wtf/). 
- **Surge L2 Block Explorer**: Monitor transactions
  on: [https://explorer.hoodi.surge.wtf](https://explorer.hoodi.surge.wtf/)

## Bridge ETH to Surge

To bridge ETH from L1 to L2:

1. Visit the [Bridge UI](https://bridge.hoodi.surge.wtf).
2. Initiate a transfer of ETH from L1 to L2.
3. Monitor your transaction using our [Blockscout Explorer](https://explorer.hoodi.surge.wtf/).

>  **Note:** Our relayer will automatically claim your bridged ETH within one minute of confirmation, under default settings.

## Deploy Your DApp

Once you’ve received your ETH on L2:

1. Deploy your DApp as you would on any other EVM-compatible network.
2. No changes to your DApp’s code are required.

Enjoy testing and building on Surge!
