# Stage 2

Surge stands out by embracing a Stage 2 governance model from the very beginning, referencing the [L2Beat’s “Stages” framework](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe) that evaluates rollup maturity. By focusing on immutability and self-executing code, Surge mitigates governance risks commonly seen in other rollups where multi-sigs or admin keys can push upgrades before users can fully withdraw their funds.

## Key Governance-Free Design Decisions

### Multi-Sig for Upgrades Only
- A Nethermind-controlled multi-sig is responsible solely for **queuing** upgrades.
- If the multi-sig holders become inactive, chain progression remains uninterrupted.

### No Security Council
- No single entity can enforce upgrades with immediate effect.
- Ensures no unilateral power to modify or halt the protocol.

### 45-Day Exit Window
- Users have a minimum of **30 days**, plus additional buffer, to exit prior to any upgrade taking effect.
- This ensures user safety by preventing sudden changes.

### Trust Code, Not Governance
- No governance tokens or DAOs influence protocol decisions.
- Minimizes centralized authority and fosters a trustless environment.

## Why Does This Matter?

Modern rollups often retain centralized elements, which can linger far longer than planned, posing systemic risk. By removing the typical emergency upgrade loopholes, Surge guarantees its users the ability to exit under predictable conditions, reinforcing Ethereum’s principles of decentralization and self-sovereignty.

Surge’s Stage 2 design means **you** have full control of your assets in the face of potential governance failures—no last-minute changes, no rushed exits, and no hidden centralized powers.
