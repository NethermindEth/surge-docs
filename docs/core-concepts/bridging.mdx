# Bridging

Surge uses Taiko's secure bridging infrastructure to enable cross-chain asset transfers between Ethereum L1 and Surge. This documentation provides an overview of how bridging works in Surge.

## Overview

The bridge enables users to transfer ETH and tokens (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155) between Ethereum and Surge. It leverages Taiko's battle-tested bridge implementation, which uses a secure cross-chain messaging system based on merkle proofs.

## How It Works

The bridging process follows these key steps:

1. **Message Sending**: When you initiate a bridge transfer, your assets are locked in a bridge contract on the source chain, and a message is sent through a Signal Service.

2. **Proof Generation**: The system generates a merkle proof that verifies your message was properly recorded on the source chain.

3. **Message Processing**: On the destination chain, the proof is verified, and your assets are released or minted accordingly.

## Supported Assets

- ETH
- ERC-20 tokens
- ERC-721 tokens (NFTs)
- ERC-1155 tokens

## Security Model

The bridge's security is based on:

- Merkle proof verification
- Cross-chain state root synchronization
- Smart contract-based message verification

## Deep Dive

For a comprehensive understanding of the bridging mechanics, including:

- Detailed message flow
- Signal Service implementation
- Cross-chain proof verification
- Token vault system

:::tip
Always verify transaction details and recipient addresses when bridging assets. While the bridge protocol is secure, user errors cannot be reversed.

The bridge UI and contract addresses will be provided once the network is live.
